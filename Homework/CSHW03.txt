1. What is a method?
* A named sequence of statements made up of a name and a body. A named block of code that optionally accepts input and returns output.

2. What is the difference between a *function* and a *procedure/subprocedure/subroutine*?
* A procedure is a method that does not return anything, a function that accepts data and possibly returns a result, a subroutine is a generic term of a procedure or a function.

3. What does a *return* statement do?
* Returns a value of a method

4. What is an *expression bodied* method?
* A shorthand way of writing out methods

5. What is the *scope* of a variable?
* The area of a program that the variable is usable in.

6. What is a *field*?
* A variable 

7. What is an *overloaded* method?
* When you give two methods the same identifier name but different parameter lists for testing

8. How do you call method that requires *arguments*?
* When you call a method, you supply a comma-separated list of arguments inside parentheses, and the number and type of the arguments are used by the compiler to select one of the overloaded methods.

9. How do you write a method, that is, specify the method definition, that requires a *parameter list*?
* specify type of method (what it returns) name of the method, parameter list, body of the method. They are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses.

10. How do you specify a parameter as optional when defining a method?
* optMethod

11. How do you pass a argument to a method as a *named parameter*?
* Specify the name of the parameter, followed by a colon and the value to use.

12. How do you return values from a method? Can you return multiple values? If so, how?
* Use a return statement. yes, use multiple parameters in the return method

13. What is a *tuple*? How do you define a method that returns multiple values? Give an example of a method that returns multiple values other than the example in th book.
* A collection of values. contains 2 values 

14. Examine the method definition on page 83 of the book. Desk check the execution of this method. What do you discover> This is called *recursion*.
* A function that calls it within itself

15. How does the compliler resolve an ambiguity between named arguments and optional parameters?
*it runs the method that parameters most closely match what its calling. if they are too similar, it will call an error and will not run.

16. What is the COM and how is the CLR dependant on the COM?
*Component Object Model
