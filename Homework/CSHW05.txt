1. What is a compound assignment operator?  How does it work?

	* Combines arithemetic operators with the assignment operators so you do not have to write out the whole expression

2. List all the compound assignment operators.

	* *= /= %= += -= 

3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5.  List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by50

	* Count += 5; var = var + 5,  count -= 50; var = var - 50

4. How long does a whileloop run?

	* Forever until the boolean expression equates to false

5. What is an iteratiion variable?  (Not in book)

	* Iteration variable is the variable that is changed each iteration of the loop.

6. What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
 
	* It will run indefinitly
	
7. How many parts does a forloop statement have?  Can you omit any of them?  Can you omit all ofthem?  What happens if you omit all of them?

	* For(initialization; termination variable Boolean expression; update control variable) statement

8. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?

	* Use a *dowhile* loop.

9. What does the breakstatement do?

	* Jumps out of the body for an iteration statemnet and continues executing at the first statement following the loop

10. What does the continuestatement do?

	* Causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediatelt after reevaluating the boolean expression

11.  (Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want to have an infinite loop?  An“infinite loop” is a loop without an update variable that in effect runs forever.  As you will see, thesekinds of loops are written intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks
